        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Prisha Vikram Kambli!
I’m a student at NMAM Institute of Technology, currently pursuing Computer Science. I’m passionate about technology and always excited to learn new skills that help me grow as a future engineer.
Apart from academics, I love expressing my creativity through painting and baking.
 

Painting helps me bring my imagination to life with colors, while baking makes me happy as I create something sweet to share with others. Both hobbies inspire me to stay balanced, creative, and motivated in everything I I have gained hands-on experience with programming languages such as C, Python, and Java, and I enjoy exploring how they can be applied to real-world challenges.

As part of my learning journey, I successfully completed an internship on ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), where I contributed to a research paper highlighting its advantages and applications. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my interest in research and innovation.        </p>
